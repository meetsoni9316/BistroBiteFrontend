Create a simple webpage illustrating the CSS Box Model

Develop a basic HTML page containing a single <div> element with text inside it. Apply CSS to showcase the different parts of the Box Model (content-box, padding, border, and margin). Set distinct colors for padding, border, and margin so that each is visually distinguishable. For example, use padding: 20px, border: 5px solid blue, and margin: 30px. Ensure that each part of the Box Model is clearly visible when the page is rendered.
Objective:

Learn to identify and manipulate the content, padding, border, and margin layers using CSS.
